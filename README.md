# Beach-Bot

Beach bot is a simple Discord Bot written in python using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) API Wrapper. This was made in collaboration with [@Zeus432](http://github.com/Zeus432).

This `rewrite` branch is has been updated particularly to cover all the topics of the latest version of discord.py, which includes components and app commands, i.e., buttons, select menus, slash commands, message and user-based context menu commands.

For a proper full description on what happens in the code, check out this link: [Beach-Bot Docs](https://bsod2528.me/pages/projects/beachbot/bot.html)
